          I am a certificate Pilates instructor for mat and apparatus since
          2009. Located in Berlin and teaches in several studios and in the city
          – Prenzlauer Berg | Charlottenburg | Weißensee | Karlshorst Offering
          Private, Duo or Group classes with mat or apparatus. The classes are
          suitable for all levels and conditions, focusing on the participant’s
          personal needs. I am an athlete and a dancer from an early age.
          Dancing has always fostered the strong bond between my body and mind.
          During training I've been exposed to Pilates as a method for body
          maintaining, recovery and improvement. I always liked working with
          people and after I complete a degree in psychology, I immediately
          started the studies for teaching Pilates. Pilates is suitable for any
          purpose – fitness, better posture, athlete’s performance improvement,
          injury rehabilitation and simply to keep on great feeling with a
          balanced body. I work as certificate Pilates instructor for mat and
          apparatus since 2009. On the years 2013-2016, I was also working daily
          with disabled and amputee in a soldier's rehabilitation center "Bet
          Halohem" in Tel Aviv. On 2016 I moved to Berlin where I am continuing
          my way in several studios with groups or private lessons. In my
          classes I emphasize accuracy and correct movement along with humor and
          fun atmosphere. My classes are in English, German and Hebrew. You are
